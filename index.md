a biographical drama that follows the torrid and temperate climate inside the mind of gilded-age inventor Nikola Tesla (Ethan Hawke), while re-presenting and delineating his *revolutionary* professional accomplishments through narrator and character Anne Morgan (Eve Hewson).

In *Tesla*, Anne, Victorian philanthropist and daughter of capitalist JP Morgan, travels space and time, from her nineteenth century salon hangs to contemporary, post-industrial New York, MacBook in hand, to tell the story of Nikola Tesla, Electrical Discoverer and Inventor, who:
- b. 1856 in Croatia, d. 1943 in Manhattan, NY
- visualized in a **flash** his idea for an alternating current motor in Europe; his friend Anital (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) witnessed Tesla's design "in the sand" and accompanied Tesla to the United States to pursue electrical innovation
- studied engineering in Prague
- worked with Thomas Edison (Kyle MacLachlan) for six months

> "Nothing grows in the shadow of an oak," Tesla says of Edison

- reproduced his alternating current system large-scale in collaboration with inventor and capitalist George Westinghouse (Jim Gaffigan)
	- Westinghouse pays Tesla $50,000 and $250/month
	- Tesla declines royalties for Westinghouse devices
- participated in the "War of the Currents," a period in which Thomas Edison campaigned against alternating current technology, calling it "impractical and deadly."
- demonstrated that alternating current is "beautiful and safe" at the Pavilion of Light, 1893 Chicago World's Fair.
- carried on some kind of relationship with performer Sarah Bernhardt (Rebecca Dayan)
- moved his operations to Colorado in 1899 to study wireless electricity and communications in a higher altitude with greater lightning storms.
- partnered with Anne's father, JP Morgan to develop a wireless communications tower for the international transfer of stock data.
- obsessed over the tower
- claimed to receive communication from Martians
- failed to implement in the industrial world the "ideas, thoughts, all the essential details finished in my mind," or what Tesla called:
	
> "light, heat, mode of power, a complete system of communication" for everybody

- or did he fail? Alternating current technology still powers the world today. See [Notes](notes.html) for more on Tesla's work (alternating current), resource links, and references.
