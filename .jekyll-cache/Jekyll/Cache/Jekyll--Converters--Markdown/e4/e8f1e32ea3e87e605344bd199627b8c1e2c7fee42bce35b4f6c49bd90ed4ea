courtyard with women, arches, sunlight
Ann Morgan
feminine narrator, matter-of-fact, â€œGoogle Teslaâ€, sits with machine, dead humor</p>

<p>â€œwork of the worldâ€
â€œset men freeâ€</p>

<p>realistic
soot and smoke in handheld-lantern when power goes out</p>

<p>devolves
into a weird, dramatic, theatrical 2D mise en scene that looks like an online video game</p>

<p>big fire not mentioned in film ?</p>

<p>Tesla big on visualization
physical and mental freshness</p>

visits with Thomas Edison, Tesla at Chicago Worldâ€™s Fair, Grand Tour
sleeps in coffin
Tesla was introduced to her as <em>â€œthe greatest inventor of the ageâ€</em>
Edison interrupts
awkward confrontation, similar to their firsts</p>
