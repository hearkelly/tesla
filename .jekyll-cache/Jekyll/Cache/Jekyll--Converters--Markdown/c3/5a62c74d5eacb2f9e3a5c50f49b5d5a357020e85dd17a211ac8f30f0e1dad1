I"?	<p>I watched this movie four times.
At my first attempt, I watched <em>Tesla</em> in three parts. Director Michael Almereyda’s experimental documentary style felt random to me. His blue and pink neon-lit scenes with their 2D-like backgrounds appeared like some online video game. Even juxtaposed with the sooted metal of an industrial age, the colors lacked emotive qualities. The characters? Never dramatic, save for Ethan Hawke’s solo</p>

<p>On my second and third attempts at understanding the film, I began to see some of the picture: the director was re-presenting, re-positioning Tesla as the forgotten, sad-mad genius of his age. That makes sense. That feels right and expected, considering that Tesla’s systems of alternating current still drive electricity distribution today. Like, globally!</p>
