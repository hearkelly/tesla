I"±<p>I watched this movie four times.
At my first attempt, I watched <em>Tesla</em> in three parts. Director â€˜s experimental documentary style felt random to me.
On my second and third attempts at understanding the film, I began to see some of the picture: the director was re-presenting, re-positioning Tesla as the forgotten, sad-mad genius of his age. That makes sense. That feels right and expected, considering that Teslaâ€™s systems of alternating current still drive electricity distribution today. Like, globally!</p>

<p>But everything else fell short and flat. Anneâ€™s matter-of-fact representation of their modern world: kinda cold, bright but gilded. In</p>
