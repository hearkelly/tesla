I"ò<p>I watched this movie four times.
At my first attempt, I watched <em>Tesla</em> in three parts. Director Michael Almereydaâ€™s experimental documentary style felt random to me: his blue and pink neon-lit scenes with their 2D-like backgrounds appeared like some online video game. Even juxtaposed with the sooted metal of an industrial age, the colors lacked emotive function. The characters? Never dramatic, save for Ethan Hawkeâ€™s rendition of â€œEverybody Wants to Rule the Worldâ€ at the filmâ€™s end.</p>

<p>On my second and third attempts at understanding the film, I began to see some of the bigger picture: the director was re-presenting, re-positioning Tesla as the forgotten, sad-mad genius of his age. That makes sense. That feels right and expected, considering that Teslaâ€™s systems of alternating current still drive energy distribution today. Like, globally!</p>

<p>I recall thinking by my fourth viewing, that, if Tesla was big on previsualization of an idea in totality, his storyteller certainly is not.</p>

<p>My favorite bits? When Tesla describes his new wireless experiments as tasks like â€œgetting the ocean to sit for a portrait.â€ And when performer Sarah Bernhardt says something like, â€œBy spending myself, I become rich.â€</p>
