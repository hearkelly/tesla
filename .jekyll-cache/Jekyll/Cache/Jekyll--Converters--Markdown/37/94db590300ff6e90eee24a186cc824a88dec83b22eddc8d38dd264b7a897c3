<p>a biographical drama that follows the torrid and temperate climate inside the mind of gilded-age inventor Nikola Tesla (Ethan Hawke), while re-presenting and delineating his <em>revolutionary</em> professional accomplishments through narrator and character Anne Morgan (Eve Hewson).</p>

<p>In <em>Tesla</em>, Anne, Victorian philanthropist and daughter of capitalist JP Morgan, travels space and time, from her nineteenth century salon hangs to contemporary, post-industrial New York, MacBook in hand, to tell the story of Nikola Tesla, Electrical Discoverer and Inventor, who:</p>
<ul>
  <li>b. 1856 in Croatia, d. 1943 in Manhattan, NY</li>
  <li>visualized in a <strong>flash</strong> his idea for an alternating current motor in Europe; his friend Anital (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) witnessed Tesla’s design “in the sand” and accompanied Tesla to the United States to pursue electrical innovation</li>
  <li>studied engineering in Prague</li>
  <li>worked with Thomas Edison (Kyle MacLachlan) for six months</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Nothing grows in the shadow of an oak,” Tesla says of Edison</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>reproduced his alternating current system large-scale in collaboration with inventor and capitalist George Westinghouse (Jim Gaffigan)
    <ul>
      <li>Westinghouse pays Tesla $50,000 and $250/month</li>
      <li>Tesla declines royalties for Westinghouse devices</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>participated in the “War of the Currents,” a period in which Thomas Edison campaigned against alternating current technology, calling it “impractical and deadly.”</li>
  <li>demonstrated that alternating current is “beautiful and safe” at the Pavilion of Light, 1893 Chicago World’s Fair.</li>
  <li>carried on some kind of relationship with performer Sarah Bernhardt</li>
  <li>moved his operations to Colorado in 1899 to study wireless electricity and communications in a higher altitude with greater lightning storms.</li>
  <li>partnered with Anne’s father, JP Morgan to develop a wireless communications tower for the international transfer of stock data.</li>
  <li>obsessed over the tower</li>
  <li>claimed to receive communication from Martians</li>
  <li>failed to implement in the industrial world the “ideas, thoughts, all the essential details finished in my mind,” or what Tesla called:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>“light, heat, mode of power, a complete system of communication” for everybody</p>
</blockquote>

  <li>or did he fail? Alternating current technology still powers the world today. See <a href="notes.html">Notes</a> for more on Tesla’s work (alternating current), resource links, and references.</li>
